Test data driven developement:

TDD is a iterative development process and each iterative starts with a set of test cases designed.
The application/ functionality code will be developed by developers based upon the test cases designed.
These test cases supposed to fail in the starting as there will not any application developed.
All the test written earlier are executed once application code is ready and necessary changes need to be made to the failed test cases.
Once all test cases are in passed test state we can be sure that particular feature is developed completely.

Benefits and drawbacks of the TDD approach:
Benefits:
1. Test cases will be covered before hand less chance of bugs in the later phase.
2. Unit testing is covered during the application development.

Drawbacks:
1.Re-writing the test cases whenever the requirement change.
2. Test Maintenance test maintenance will be more.
